# PNG Replacer
This feature is targeting server owners/staff but may be useful to certain advanced players as-well.

## Description
This feature gives you the ability to use `png` files to replace specific gump and item art graphics, without the need for mul/uop patchers.

## How do I use this?
You will need to create a few directories in your TazUO folder:
```
/ExternalImages/
/ExternalImages/gumps/
/ExternalImages/art/
```

1. Now find the gump or art id you would like to replace, lets say gump id `83`
2. Create your art and save it under `/gumps/` like this: `ExternalImages/gumps/83.png`  
    ℹ️ `.png` must be **lower** case
3. Restart your client and open the gump that uses that art, it will be replaced with your png file!
