This is an alternative version of the offical CUO client.

Installation is easy:

1. `build` the project **OR** downloaded the [latest release](https://github.com/bittiez/ClassicUO/releases/latest)

2. Put that folder wherever you want your install to be located `Documents/CustomCUO/` for example

3. Copy your old `settings.json` and `/Data/` folder from your old CUO install into your new directory

       You can skip this step(3) if you don't want your old settings and profiles(macros/gumps/spell bars/etc) copied over

4. Run ClassicUO.exe in your new directory!


Your finished directory should look something like this(with a few more files than this):
